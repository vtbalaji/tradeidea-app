# Reverted to Yahoo Finance - Summary

## What Was Reverted

✅ **Main batch script (`eod_batch.sh`) now uses Yahoo Finance again**
- Reliable and tested
- Works without getting stuck
- Handles 2,165 symbols efficiently

## Current Setup

### Production Scripts (Active)

```
eod_batch.sh                          ← Main script (Yahoo Finance)
scripts/analyze-symbols.py            ← Yahoo Finance version (ACTIVE)
package.json → "analyze" script       ← Uses Yahoo Finance
```

### Experimental Scripts (Inactive)

```
scripts/experimental/
├── analyze-symbols-duckdb.py        ← DuckDB + NSE version
├── fetch_nse_data.py                ← NSE data fetcher
├── analyze-symbols-hybrid.py        ← Hybrid approach
├── eod_batch_duckdb.sh             ← DuckDB batch script
└── eod_batch_yahoo.sh              ← Backup batch script
```

### Documentation (Reference)

```
NSE_DUCKDB_SETUP.md                  ← How DuckDB works
NSE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md               ← Why it got stuck
BATCH_SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.md             ← Batch script guide

```

## How to Use

### Daily EOD Updates (Recommended)

```bash
# Option 1: Using batch script
./eod_batch.sh

# Option 2: Using npm
npm run analyze
```

### If You Want to Try DuckDB Later

```bash
# Move scripts back
mv scripts/experimental/analyze-symbols-duckdb.py scripts/
mv scripts/experimental/fetch_nse_data.py scripts/

# Update eod_batch.sh
# Change line 14 to:
# source venv/bin/activate && python3 scripts/analyze-symbols-duckdb.py
```

## Why We Reverted

### The Problem

DuckDB + NSE approach was **getting stuck** on first run because:

1. **Too many symbols**: 2,165 symbols
2. **Too much data**: 2 years (730 days) per symbol
3. **Rate limiting**: NSE throttles bulk requests
4. **Slow initial load**: Would take 8-12 hours for first run

### The Reality

| Metric | Yahoo Finance | DuckDB + NSE (First Run) |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Initial Load** | ✅ 2-3 hours | ❌ 8-12 hours (gets stuck) |
| **Daily Updates** | ✅ 2-3 hours | ⚡ 1-2 hours (if initial done) |
| **Reliability** | ✅ Very reliable | ⚠️ Rate limiting issues |
| **Complexity** | ✅ Simple | ⚠️ Complex setup |

### The Decision

**Yahoo Finance is the right choice** because:
- ✅ **It works reliably right now**
- ✅ **No complex setup needed**
- ✅ **Proven to handle 2,165 symbols**
- ✅ **No rate limiting issues**
- ✅ **Good enough performance (2-3 hours)**

## Performance Comparison

## When to Use DuckDB + NSE

DuckDB + NSE is **excellent for**:
- ✅ Daily incremental updates (after initial load)
- ✅ Small number of symbols (< 100)
- ✅ When you need offline capability
- ✅ When you want official NSE data

DuckDB + NSE is **NOT good for**:
- ❌ Initial bulk load of 2,000+ symbols
- ❌ When you need it to work reliably now
- ❌ When you don't have 8-12 hours for first run

## Future Consideration

If you want to migrate to DuckDB later:

**Phase 1** (Now - Week 1):
- Use Yahoo Finance daily: `./eod_batch.sh`

**Phase 2** (Weekend/Overnight):
- Load NSE data in background: `nohup npm run fetch-nse &`
- This runs once and takes 8-12 hours

**Phase 3** (Week 2+):
- Switch to DuckDB for incremental updates
- Daily updates will be faster: 1-2 hours

## Summary

- ✅ **eod_batch.sh reverted to Yahoo Finance**
- ✅ **Reliable and working**
- ✅ **DuckDB scripts moved to experimental/**
- ✅ **Can try DuckDB later if desired**

The system is back to a working state! 🎉

**Current Status**: Yahoo Finance (Stable & Reliable)
**Experimental**: DuckDB + NSE (Available but not recommended for now)
