# Daily EOD Setup - Complete Guide

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
- `todayClose` (₹353) from macrossover200 collection didn't match `lastPrice` (₹349) shown in UI
- Screeners were trying to use NSE data but DuckDB wasn't installed
- Two different data sources causing confusion

### Solution
✅ **Installed NSE EOD data fetching** using DuckDB + jugaad-data
✅ **Created unified workflow** for daily data updates
✅ **Added `lastPrice` field** to all screener results for UI consistency

---

## How It Works Now

### Three Data Sources Working Together

| Component | Data Source | Purpose | Storage |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| **NSE EOD Fetcher** | NSE (jugaad-data) | Official EOD prices | DuckDB (`data/eod.duckdb`) |
| **Technical Analysis** | Yahoo Finance | Indicators + live price | Firebase (`symbols/{symbol}/technical`) |
| **Screeners** | DuckDB + Firebase | Crossovers + both prices | Firebase collections |

### Screener Collections Now Include Both Prices

- `todayClose`: Official NSE closing price (for crossover calculation)
- `lastPrice`: Yahoo Finance price (for UI display consistency)

Example for BIOCON in `macrossover200`:
```json
{
  "symbol": "NS_BIOCON",
  "todayClose": 353.00,     // NSE official
  "lastPrice": 349.40,      // Yahoo Finance
  "todayMA": 350.00,
  "crossoverType": "bullish_cross"
}
```

## Installation (One-Time Setup)

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install --break-system-packages duckdb jugaad-data pandas numpy ta yfinance firebase-admin
```

### 2. Verify Installation

```bash
python3 -c "import duckdb, pandas, ta, yfinance; print('✅ All dependencies installed')"
```

---

## Daily Workflow

### Option A: Run Complete Batch (Recommended)

```bash
# Run after 6 PM IST
./scripts/daily-eod-batch.sh
```

This executes:
1. `fetch-eod-data.py` - Fetches NSE EOD data (5-10 min)
2. `analyze-symbols.py` - Runs technical analysis (10-20 min)
3. `screeners.py` - Detects crossovers (2-3 min)

**Total time:** ~15-30 minutes

### Option B: Run Individual Scripts

```bash
# 1. Fetch NSE EOD data first
python3 scripts/fetch-eod-data.py

# 2. Then technical analysis
python3 scripts/analyze-symbols.py

# 3. Finally screeners
python3 scripts/screeners.py
```

---

## Automation

### Set up Cron Job (Daily at 6:30 PM IST)

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (adjust path)
30 18 * * 1-5 cd /path/to/myportfolio-web && ./scripts/daily-eod-batch.sh >> logs/eod-batch.log 2>&1
```

Runs Monday-Friday after market closes.

## Verification

### Check DuckDB Data

```bash
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'scripts/experimental')
from fetch_nse_data import NSEDataFetcher
fetcher = NSEDataFetcher()
stats = fetcher.get_stats()
print(f'Symbols: {stats[\"total_symbols\"]}')
print(f'Latest: {stats[\"max_date\"]}')
fetcher.close()
"
```

### Check Screener Results

View in Firebase Console:
- `macrossover50` - 50 MA crossovers
- `macrossover200` - 200 MA crossovers
- `supertrendcrossover` - Supertrend signals
- `volumespike` - Volume spike alerts

Each should have both `todayClose` and `lastPrice` fields.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors
```bash
pip3 install --break-system-packages duckdb jugaad-data pandas
```

### NSE API rate limiting
- Script includes 0.5s delay between requests
- If still failing, run during evening (7-8 PM)
- Check NSE website is accessible

### DuckDB empty/outdated
```bash
# Clear and re-fetch
rm -rf data/eod.duckdb
python3 scripts/fetch-eod-data.py
```

### Screeners showing "No crossovers"
- Run after market hours (NSE publishes data after 6 PM)
- Crossovers are rare - may not happen every day
- Check DuckDB has recent data

## Files Created

### Scripts
- `scripts/fetch-eod-data.py` - NSE EOD data fetcher
- `scripts/daily-eod-batch.sh` - Complete workflow
- `scripts/screeners.py` - Updated with `lastPrice` field

### Documentation
- `scripts/EOD_BATCH_WORKFLOW.md` - Detailed workflow guide
- `scripts/README.md` - Updated with quick start
- `DAILY_EOD_SETUP.md` - This file

### Data
- `data/eod.duckdb` - NSE EOD data storage (created on first run)

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run first batch to populate DuckDB:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/fetch-eod-data.py
   ```

2. ✅ Test complete workflow:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/daily-eod-batch.sh
   ```

3. ✅ Set up cron job for daily automation

4. ✅ Monitor logs for first few days

5. ✅ Update frontend to display both prices if needed:
   - `todayClose` - For showing crossover reference
   - `lastPrice` - For current price display

---

## Why Both Prices?

**NSE Official Data is used for:**
- ✅ Accurate crossover detection
- ✅ Official settlement prices
- ✅ Regulatory compliance

**Yahoo Finance is used for:**
- ✅ Technical indicators (2 years of data)
- ✅ Consistent UI display
- ✅ Real-time updates during market hours

**Both are now available** in screener results - use whichever fits your UI needs!

## Support

For issues:
1. Check logs: `logs/eod-batch.log`
2. Verify dependencies are installed
3. Check NSE website accessibility
4. See [EOD_BATCH_WORKFLOW.md](scripts/EOD_BATCH_WORKFLOW.md) for detailed troubleshooting
