## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Created New Folder Structure ✅
- `batch/` - For orchestration shell scripts
- `technical/` - For EOD and technical analysis
- `fundamental/` - For XBRL and fundamental analysis
- `portfolio/` - For portfolio management
- `onetime/` - For test and one-time scripts

### 2. Moved Scripts to Appropriate Folders ✅

**batch/ (5 shell scripts):**
- `daily-eod-batch.sh`
- `weekly-fundamentals-batch.sh`
- `run-eod-with-quality-check.sh`
- `process_downloaded_xbrl.sh`
- `top50.sh`

**technical/ (5 scripts):**
- `fetch-eod-data.py`
- `analyze-symbols-duckdb.py`
- `generate-chart-data.py`
- `yahoo_fundamentals_fetcher.py`
- `fetch-nifty50-index.py`

**fundamental/ (9 scripts):**
- `xbrl_parser_v3.py`
- `xbrl_eod.py`
- `fundamental_calculator.py`
- `fundamental_xbrl_storage.py`
- `fundamental_duckdb_storage.py`
- `organize_xbrl_files.py`
- `fetch_nse_financial_results.py`
- `yahoo_xbrl_enricher.py`
- `backfill_download_tracking.py`

**analysis/ (5 scripts):**
- `enhanced_company_report_v2.py`

**onetime/ (5 scripts):**

- `test_xbrl_pipeline.py`
- `test_xbrl_comprehensive_v2.py`
- `extract_metrics_for_validation.py`
- `extract_test_data_metrics.py`

**admin/ (3 scripts):**
- `setup-venv.sh`
- `deploy.sh`
- `view-duckdb.sh`

**shared/ (5 utilities):**
- `fundamental_metrics.py`
- `forensic_scores.py`
- `valuation.py`
- `load_env.py`
- `__init__.py`

### 3. Created README.md for Each Folder ✅

Every folder now has a comprehensive README.md with:
- Script purposes
- Usage examples
- Configuration details
- Troubleshooting tips
- Related folders

### 4. Tested After Reorganization ✅

Tested quarterly report successfully:
```bash
./venv/bin/python3 scripts/reports/quarterly_financial_report.py TCS --quarters 2
# ✅ Works perfectly!
```

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

### Before Reorganization:
❌ 34+ scripts cluttered in root `scripts/` folder  
❌ Hard to find what you need  
❌ No clear organization  
❌ No documentation  

### After Reorganization:
✅ **Clear structure** - Easy to navigate  
✅ **Well documented** - README in every folder  
✅ **Logical grouping** - Related scripts together  
✅ **Entry points clear** - All batch scripts in `batch/`  
✅ **Separation of concerns** - Technical vs Fundamental  
✅ **Easy maintenance** - Know where to add new scripts
