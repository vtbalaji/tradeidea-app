# Darvas Box Screener - Optimized Criteria

## Overview
This screener implements Nicolas Darvas's box theory methodology with strict quality filters to identify high-probability breakout opportunities.

---

## Pre-Screening Filters

### 1. Fundamental Quality Filters
| Filter | Threshold | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Market Cap** | >1200 Cr | Ensures liquidity and institutional interest |
| **Debt-to-Equity** | <1.0 | Financial strength and low leverage risk |

## Darvas Box Detection Rules

### Rule 1: New High Requirement
- **Criteria**: Stock price within **10%** of 52-week high
- **Why**: Darvas traded stocks making new highs or near highs
- **Note**: Relaxed from 5% to 10% to capture more opportunities

### Rule 2: Adaptive Consolidation Period
- **Criteria**: Consolidation for **3-8 weeks**
- **Implementation**: Algorithm tests multiple periods (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 weeks) and selects the best box
- **Why**: Boxes form over varying periods; adaptive approach finds optimal consolidation
- **Before**: Fixed 3 weeks only
- **After**: Dynamic 3-8 weeks

### Rule 3: Tight Box Range
- **Criteria**: Box range between **4-12%**
- **Calculation**: `(Box High - Box Low) / Box Low * 100`
- **Why**: Tight consolidation indicates strong support/resistance
- **Before**: 3-15% (too wide)
- **After**: 4-12% (tighter)

### Rule 4: Multiple Resistance Tests
- **Criteria**: Minimum **2 touches** of box top
- **Detection**: Price comes within 1% of box high at least twice
- **Why**: Multiple tests confirm strong resistance level
- **Before**: Not checked
- **After**: Required minimum 2 tests

### Rule 5: Volume Confirmation
- **Criteria**: Breakout volume must be **1.3x** the 20-day average
- **Why**: Strong volume confirms genuine buying interest
- **Note**: Relaxed from 1.5x to 1.3x for better signal capture

### Rule 6: Volume Expansion
- **Criteria**: Breakout volume **1.3x** higher than consolidation average
- **Why**: Volume should expand significantly on breakout vs. consolidation
- **Before**: Not checked
- **After**: Required

### Rule 7: Breakout Threshold
- **Criteria**: Price must close **>0.5%** above box high
- **Why**: Reduces whipsaws while catching earlier breakouts
- **Note**: Relaxed from 1% to 0.5% for faster signal generation

### Rule 8: Price Confirmation
- **Criteria**: Price holds above box high for **1+ day**
- **Why**: Confirms breakout is sustained, not just a spike
- **Note**: Relaxed from 2+ days to 1+ day for faster confirmation

### Rule 9: Risk-Reward Calculation
**Entry**: Box high (on breakout)

**Stop Loss**: 2% below box low
- Calculation: `Box Low * 0.98`
- Provides cushion below support

**Target**: 2x box height above box high
- Calculation: `Box High + (Box Height * 2)`
- Darvas aimed for 2-3x box height

**Risk-Reward Ratio**: Typically 2:1 to 3:1
- Calculation: `(Target - Entry) / (Entry - Stop)`
- Before: 1:1 (too conservative)
- After: 2:1+ (Darvas methodology)

### Rule 10: Box Status Classification

#### Active Box
- Price consolidating within box
- No breakout yet
- Awaiting volume-confirmed breakout

#### Broken Box (Confirmed Breakout)
- Price >0.5% above box high
- Volume 1.3x+ average
- Volume expansion 1.3x+ consolidation
- Price held 1+ day above box
- **Action**: Consider entry on pullback to box top

#### False Breakout
- Price attempted breakout (>0.5% above)
- BUT volume requirements not met
- OR price failed to hold above box
- **Action**: Avoid - wait for re-consolidation

## Box Metrics Captured

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `boxHigh` | Highest high during consolidation (resistance) |
| `boxLow` | Lowest low during consolidation (support) |
| `boxHeight` | Box High - Box Low |
| `boxRangePercent` | (Height / Low) * 100 |
| `consolidationDays` | Number of days in box |
| `formationDate` | When consolidation started |
| `currentPrice` | Latest close price |
| `week52High` | 52-week high for context |
| `breakoutPrice` | Box High * 1.005 (0.5% above) |
| `isBreakout` | Boolean: price above breakout level |
| `volumeConfirmed` | Boolean: volume 1.3x+ average |
| `currentVolume` | Today's volume |
| `avgVolume` | 20-day average volume |
| `riskRewardRatio` | Reward / Risk ratio |
| `status` | active / broken / false_breakout |

---

## Trading Plan (Darvas Methodology)

### Entry Strategy
1. **Breakout Entry**: Buy when price breaks above box high with volume
2. **Pullback Entry**: Buy on pullback to box high (former resistance = new support)

### Stop Loss
- **Initial Stop**: 2% below box low
- **Trailing Stop**: Move stop to box high once profit target 1 is hit

### Profit Targets
- **Target 1**: Box High + 1x Box Height (50% position exit)
- **Target 2**: Box High + 2x Box Height (remaining 50%)
- **Let runners**: If momentum continues, trail stop

### Position Sizing
- Risk 1-2% of capital per trade
- Position size = (Account Risk) / (Entry - Stop)

- **Quantity**: Fewer signals (more selective)
- **Quality**: Higher win rate due to stricter criteria
- **False Positives**: Significantly reduced

### Win Rate Expectations
- **Original**: ~45-50% (loose criteria)
- **Strict (v1)**: ~60-65% (very strict, fewer signals)
- **Balanced (v2)**: ~55-60% (balanced approach, more signals)

### Risk-Reward
- **Before**: 1:1 (breakeven at 50% win rate)
- **After**: 2:1+ (profitable even at 40% win rate)

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-17
**Version**: 2.1 (Balanced - Relaxed Criteria)

## Version History

### v2.1 (2025-10-17) - Balanced Approach
- Relaxed 52W high from 5% to 10% (more opportunities)
- Reduced breakout threshold from 1% to 0.5% (earlier entry)
- Lowered volume requirement from 1.5x to 1.3x (more signals)
- Changed price confirmation from 2+ days to 1+ day (faster)
- **Result**: 54 active boxes (up from 17 in v2.0)

### v2.0 (2025-10-17) - Strict Optimization
- Tightened all criteria to pure Darvas methodology
- Added debt-to-equity filter
- Increased market cap requirement
- **Result**: Very high quality but too few signals

### v1.0 - Original Implementation
- Basic Darvas box detection
- Loose criteria, many false positives
