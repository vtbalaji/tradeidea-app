# Darvas Box Screener - Optimized Criteria

## Overview
This screener implements Nicolas Darvas's box theory methodology with strict quality filters to identify high-probability breakout opportunities.

## Pre-Screening Filters

### 1. Fundamental Quality Filters
| Filter | Threshold | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Market Cap** | >1200 Cr | Ensures liquidity and institutional interest |
| **Debt-to-Equity** | <1.0 | Financial strength and low leverage risk |

## Darvas Box Detection Rules

### Rule 1: New High Requirement
- **Criteria**: Stock price within **5%** of 52-week high
- **Why**: Darvas only traded stocks making new highs
- **Before**: Within 10% (too loose)
- **After**: Within 5% (stricter)

### Rule 2: Adaptive Consolidation Period
- **Criteria**: Consolidation for **3-8 weeks**
- **Implementation**: Algorithm tests multiple periods (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 weeks) and selects the best box
- **Why**: Boxes form over varying periods; adaptive approach finds optimal consolidation
- **Before**: Fixed 3 weeks only
- **After**: Dynamic 3-8 weeks

### Rule 3: Tight Box Range
- **Criteria**: Box range between **4-12%**
- **Calculation**: `(Box High - Box Low) / Box Low * 100`
- **Why**: Tight consolidation indicates strong support/resistance
- **Before**: 3-15% (too wide)
- **After**: 4-12% (tighter)

### Rule 4: Multiple Resistance Tests
- **Criteria**: Minimum **2 touches** of box top
- **Detection**: Price comes within 1% of box high at least twice
- **Why**: Multiple tests confirm strong resistance level
- **Before**: Not checked
- **After**: Required minimum 2 tests

### Rule 5: Strong Volume Confirmation
- **Criteria**: Breakout volume must be **1.5x** the 20-day average
- **Why**: Strong volume confirms genuine buying interest
- **Before**: 1.2x average (weak)
- **After**: 1.5x average (strong)

### Rule 6: Volume Expansion
- **Criteria**: Breakout volume **1.3x** higher than consolidation average
- **Why**: Volume should expand significantly on breakout vs. consolidation
- **Before**: Not checked
- **After**: Required

### Rule 7: Tight Breakout Threshold
- **Criteria**: Price must close **>1%** above box high
- **Why**: Reduces whipsaws and false breakouts
- **Before**: 2% above (loose)
- **After**: 1% above (tighter)

### Rule 8: Price Confirmation
- **Criteria**: Price holds above box high for **2+ days**
- **Why**: Confirms breakout is sustained, not just a spike
- **Before**: Not checked
- **After**: Required for "broken" status

### Rule 9: Risk-Reward Calculation
**Entry**: Box high (on breakout)

**Stop Loss**: 2% below box low
- Calculation: `Box Low * 0.98`
- Provides cushion below support

**Target**: 2x box height above box high
- Calculation: `Box High + (Box Height * 2)`
- Darvas aimed for 2-3x box height

**Risk-Reward Ratio**: Typically 2:1 to 3:1
- Calculation: `(Target - Entry) / (Entry - Stop)`
- Before: 1:1 (too conservative)
- After: 2:1+ (Darvas methodology)

### Rule 10: Box Status Classification

#### Active Box
- Price consolidating within box
- No breakout yet
- Awaiting volume-confirmed breakout

#### Broken Box (Confirmed Breakout)
- Price >1% above box high
- Volume 1.5x+ average
- Volume expansion 1.3x+ consolidation
- Price held 2+ days above box
- **Action**: Consider entry on pullback to box top

#### False Breakout
- Price attempted breakout (>1% above)
- BUT volume requirements not met
- OR price failed to hold above box
- **Action**: Avoid - wait for re-consolidation

## Box Metrics Captured

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `boxHigh` | Highest high during consolidation (resistance) |
| `boxLow` | Lowest low during consolidation (support) |
| `boxHeight` | Box High - Box Low |
| `boxRangePercent` | (Height / Low) * 100 |
| `consolidationDays` | Number of days in box |
| `formationDate` | When consolidation started |
| `currentPrice` | Latest close price |
| `week52High` | 52-week high for context |
| `breakoutPrice` | Box High * 1.01 (1% above) |
| `isBreakout` | Boolean: price above breakout level |
| `volumeConfirmed` | Boolean: volume 1.5x+ average |
| `currentVolume` | Today's volume |
| `avgVolume` | 20-day average volume |
| `riskRewardRatio` | Reward / Risk ratio |
| `status` | active / broken / false_breakout |

## Trading Plan (Darvas Methodology)

### Entry Strategy
1. **Breakout Entry**: Buy when price breaks above box high with volume
2. **Pullback Entry**: Buy on pullback to box high (former resistance = new support)

### Stop Loss
- **Initial Stop**: 2% below box low
- **Trailing Stop**: Move stop to box high once profit target 1 is hit

### Profit Targets
- **Target 1**: Box High + 1x Box Height (50% position exit)
- **Target 2**: Box High + 2x Box Height (remaining 50%)
- **Let runners**: If momentum continues, trail stop

### Position Sizing
- Risk 1-2% of capital per trade
- Position size = (Account Risk) / (Entry - Stop)
