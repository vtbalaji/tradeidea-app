# Batch Scripts - Fixed After Reorganization ✅

**Issue:** After reorganizing scripts into folders, batch scripts couldn't find virtual environment or Python scripts.

**Root Cause:** Batch scripts were looking for project root one level up, but after moving to `scripts/batch/`, they needed to go up TWO levels.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Project Root Path
**Before:**
```bash
PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$SCRIPT_DIR/.." && pwd)"  # Only goes up 1 level
```

**After:**
```bash
PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$SCRIPT_DIR/../.." && pwd)"  # Goes up 2 levels
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Now correctly finds project root
- ✅ Virtual environment detected
- ✅ Python 3.13.7 found

### 2. Python Script Paths
Updated all script references to new folder structure:

| Old Path | New Path |
|----------|----------|
| `scripts/fetch-eod-data.py` | `scripts/technical/fetch-eod-data.py` |
| `scripts/analyze-symbols-duckdb.py` | `scripts/technical/analyze-symbols-duckdb.py` |
| `scripts/generate-chart-data.py` | `scripts/technical/generate-chart-data.py` |
| `scripts/screeners.py` | `scripts/analysis/screeners.py` |
| `scripts/manage-portfolio-stoploss.py` | `scripts/portfolio/manage-portfolio-stoploss.py` |
| `scripts/check-idea-triggers.py` | `scripts/portfolio/check-idea-triggers.py` |
| `scripts/expire-ideas.py` | `scripts/portfolio/expire-ideas.py` |
| `scripts/xbrl_eod.py` | `scripts/fundamental/xbrl_eod.py` |
| `scripts/fetch_nse_financial_results.py` | `scripts/fundamental/fetch_nse_financial_results.py` |

## 📋 All Fixed Batch Scripts

✅ `scripts/batch/daily-eod-batch.sh`  
✅ `scripts/batch/weekly-fundamentals-batch.sh`  
✅ `scripts/batch/run-eod-with-quality-check.sh`  
✅ `scripts/batch/process_downloaded_xbrl.sh`  
✅ `scripts/batch/top50.sh`

## 🧪 Test Results

```bash
./scripts/batch/daily-eod-batch.sh

[2025-10-28 10:49:21] 🚀 Starting Daily EOD Batch Process
[2025-10-28 10:49:21] Project Root: /Volumes/ssd-backup/git/SmartFarm/myportfolio-web  ✅
[2025-10-28 10:49:21] 🐍 Using Python: ./venv/bin/python3  ✅
[2025-10-28 10:49:21] Python Version: Python 3.13.7  ✅
```

**Status:** ✅ Batch orchestration working perfectly!

---

## 🚀 Usage

All batch scripts can now be run from anywhere:

```bash
# From project root
./scripts/batch/daily-eod-batch.sh

# From scripts folder
cd scripts && ./batch/daily-eod-batch.sh

# From batch folder
cd scripts/batch && ./daily-eod-batch.sh
```

All will correctly find the project root and virtual environment.
