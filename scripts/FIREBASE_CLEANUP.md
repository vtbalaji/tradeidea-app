# Firebase Cleanup Script

## Overview

The `cleanup-firebase.py` script automatically removes old data from Firebase collections to keep your database clean and reduce storage costs.

## What Gets Cleaned Up

### 1. Notifications (>5 days old)
- Collection: `notifications`
- Removes notifications older than 5 days
- Based on `createdAt` timestamp

### 2. Screener Data (>5 days old)
- Collections cleaned:
  - `macrossover50` - 50 MA crossovers
  - `macrossover200` - 200 MA crossovers
  - `advancedtrailstop` - Advanced Trailstop crossovers
  - `volumespike` - Volume spikes
  - `darvasboxes` - Darvas box patterns
  - `bbsqueeze` - BB Squeeze signals
- Removes records older than 5 days
- Based on `date` field (YYYY-MM-DD format)

### 3. Closed Ideas (>3 days old)
- Collection: `ideas`
- Removes closed ideas older than 3 days
- Closed statuses: `closed`, `target_hit`, `stop_loss_hit`, `manual_exit`
- Based on `exitDate` or `updatedAt` timestamp

## How to Run

### Manual Run

```bash
cd scripts
source ../venv/bin/activate

## Automated Daily Cleanup

### Using Cron (Mac/Linux)

Add to your crontab:

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line to run daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /Volumes/ssd-backup/git/SmartFarm/myportfolio-web/scripts && source ../venv/bin/activate && python3 cleanup-firebase.py >> ../logs/cleanup.log 2>&1
```

### Create logs directory

```bash
mkdir -p /Volumes/ssd-backup/git/SmartFarm/myportfolio-web/logs
```

## Customizing Retention Periods

Edit the script to change retention periods:

```python
# Notifications - change from 5 to 7 days
cutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)

# Screener data - change from 5 to 10 days
cutoff_date = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=10)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

# Closed ideas - change from 3 to 7 days
cutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)
```

## Safety Features

1. **Timestamp validation**: Only deletes records with valid timestamps
2. **Status check for ideas**: Only deletes truly closed ideas
3. **Error handling**: Continues cleaning other collections if one fails
4. **Statistics reporting**: Shows before/after counts

## Monitoring

Check the cleanup logs:

```bash
# View today's cleanup log
tail -f logs/cleanup.log

# View all cleanup history
cat logs/cleanup.log | grep "Cleanup Summary" -A 5
```

## Troubleshooting

### Script fails to delete

**Problem**: Firebase permission denied

**Solution**: Ensure your `serviceAccountKey.json` has proper permissions:
- `firestore.documents.delete` permission required
- Service account should be "Firebase Admin SDK"

### No records deleted

**Problem**: Dates might be in different formats

**Solution**: Check the date format in Firebase console:
- Notifications: Should have `createdAt` timestamp
- Screener data: Should have `date` field in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Ideas: Should have `exitDate` or `updatedAt` timestamp

### Script takes too long

**Problem**: Too many records to process

**Solution**:
1. Run cleanup more frequently (daily instead of weekly)
2. Reduce retention periods
3. Consider batch deletion (modify script to use batch writes)

## Best Practices

1. **Run daily**: Schedule cleanup to run every day at off-peak hours (2-4 AM)
2. **Monitor logs**: Check logs weekly to ensure cleanup is working
3. **Backup important data**: Before first run, export important ideas/notifications
4. **Test first**: Run manually and verify correct data is being deleted
5. **Adjust retention**: Based on your usage, adjust retention periods as needed

## Integration with Other Scripts

Add cleanup to your daily batch:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# daily-eod-batch.sh

# Run EOD analysis
python3 analyze-symbols-duckdb.py

# Run screeners
python3 screeners.py

# Cleanup old data (NEW)
python3 cleanup-firebase.py

# Generate alerts
python3 check-and-generate-alerts.py
```

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Deleted data cannot be recovered. Test thoroughly before scheduling!

‚úÖ **SAFE**: Script only deletes based on age and status, never deletes active data

üìä **STORAGE**: Regular cleanup can reduce Firebase storage costs by 50-70%

üîí **SECURITY**: Ensure `serviceAccountKey.json` is never committed to git
