Shared utilities for financial analysis

This module provides reusable components for:
- Forensic score calculations (M-Score, Z-Score, F-Score, J-Score)
- Fundamental metrics (ROE, ROA, margins, ratios)
- Valuation calculations (Graham Number, DCF, P/E based)
- Technical indicators

All scripts should import from here to maintain consistency and avoid duplication.
