Option 1: Direct CLI access

  duckdb /Volumes/ssd-backup/git/SmartFarm/myportfolio-web/data/eod.duckdb -readonly

  Option 2: Quick helper script (easier)

  # Interactive mode
  ./scripts/view-duckdb.sh

  # Or run a quick query
  ./scripts/view-duckdb.sh "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ohlcv"
  ./scripts/view-duckdb.sh "SELECT DISTINCT symbol FROM ohlcv LIMIT 10"

  Useful SQL queries once inside:

  -- Show all tables
  SHOW TABLES;

  -- Table structure
  DESCRIBE ohlcv;

  -- Database stats
  SELECT
      COUNT(*) as total_rows,
      COUNT(DISTINCT symbol) as total_symbols,
      MIN(date) as earliest_date,
      MAX(date) as latest_date
  FROM ohlcv;

  -- Recent data for a symbol
  SELECT * FROM ohlcv
  WHERE symbol = 'RELIANCE'
  ORDER BY date DESC
  LIMIT 5;

  The -readonly flag allows you to view data even while the fetch script is running!
