# EOD Batch Scripts Summary

## Available Scripts

### 1. `eod_batch.sh` ⭐ **MAIN - Now uses DuckDB + NSE**

```bash
./eod_batch.sh
```

**Updated to use the new DuckDB + NSE system!**

- ✅ Faster (incremental updates)
- ✅ Official NSE data
- ✅ Offline capable
- ✅ No rate limits
- 🎯 **Use this for production/cron jobs**

### 2. `eod_batch_duckdb.sh` (Same as above)

```bash
./eod_batch_duckdb.sh
```

Identical to `eod_batch.sh` - created as explicit backup.

### 3. `eod_batch_yahoo.sh` 🔙 **BACKUP - Yahoo Finance**

```bash
./eod_batch_yahoo.sh
```

Original version using Yahoo Finance API.

- Use as fallback if DuckDB has issues
- Kept for comparison/debugging
- Slower, has rate limits

0 18 * * 1-5 cd /path/to/myportfolio-web && ./eod_batch.sh >> logs/eod.log 2>&1

```

## Testing

1. **Test the script manually:**
   ```bash
   ./eod_batch.sh
   ```

2. **Check the output:**
   - Should see "DuckDB + NSE" in header
   - Should show incremental updates
   - Should display database statistics at end

3. **Verify Firestore:**
   - Check that symbols have updated `technical` data
   - Verify `lastFetched` timestamp is recent

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to revert to Yahoo Finance:

```bash
# Edit eod_batch.sh
# Change line 14 from:
source venv/bin/activate && python3 scripts/analyze-symbols-duckdb.py

# Back to:
source venv/bin/activate && python3 scripts/analyze-symbols.py
```

Or simply use the backup:
```bash
./eod_batch_yahoo.sh
```

## Performance Comparison

### First Run (Initial Load)

| Script | Time per Symbol |
|--------|----------------|
| `eod_batch_yahoo.sh` | ~3-5 seconds |
| `eod_batch.sh` (DuckDB) | ~30-60 seconds* |

*Fetches 2 years of data, but only happens once

### Subsequent Runs (Daily)

| Script | Time per Symbol |
|--------|----------------|
| `eod_batch_yahoo.sh` | ~3-5 seconds |
| `eod_batch.sh` (DuckDB) | **~1-2 seconds** ⚡ |

**Result**: After initial load, DuckDB is 2-3x faster!

## FAQ

### Q: Can I still use the old script?
**A:** Yes! Use `./eod_batch_yahoo.sh`

### Q: Will my cron jobs break?
**A:** No! If you're calling `./eod_batch.sh`, it will now use DuckDB automatically.

### Q: What if NSE data fetch fails?
**A:** The script will show errors but continue with other symbols. You can always run `./eod_batch_yahoo.sh` as fallback.

### Q: How do I know it's working?
**A:** Look for "DuckDB + NSE" in the header and "DuckDB Statistics" at the end.

### Q: Do I need to download anything?
**A:** No! Dependencies already installed:
- `jugaad-data` (NSE data)
- `duckdb` (database)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Run once manually** to verify: `./eod_batch.sh`
2. 📊 **Check database** was created: `ls -lh data/eod.duckdb`
3. 🔄 **Update cron jobs** if you have any
4. 📝 **Monitor logs** for first few automated runs
5. 🗑️ **Optional**: Move old scripts to `unused/` after 1 week of successful runs

## Need Help?

- Check `NSE_DUCKDB_SETUP.md` for detailed documentation
- Test individual components:
  - NSE fetch: `npm run fetch-nse`
  - Analysis: `npm run analyze-duckdb`
- Compare with old version: Run both scripts side-by-side

---

**Summary**: Yes, you can use the same `eod_batch.sh` - it's been updated to use DuckDB + NSE! 🎉
